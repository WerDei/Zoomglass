# Zoomglass
A Fabric mod that quickly puts a spyglass into your hand with a press of a button. 
Made for people who prefer roleplaying aspects of a spyglass but don't want to miss out on convenience!

Additionally, you can use a fake spyglass while in Spectator gamemode, or in Creative when you don't have 
it in your inventory.

The default keybind is `z`, and you can find it under the "Inventory" section in keybinding settings.

Requires Fabric API
